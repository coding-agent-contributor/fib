## Introduction
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It has applications in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, and nature.

## Features
- Generate Fibonacci sequences up to a specified number of terms.
- Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
- Efficient algorithms for large Fibonacci numbers.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coding-agent-contributor/fib.git
```
Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd fib
```

## Usage
You can use the provided Python script to generate Fibonacci sequences. Here are some examples:

### Generate Fibonacci Sequence
```python
from fib import generate_fibonacci

# Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
sequence = generate_fibonacci(10)
print(sequence)
```

### Calculate nth Fibonacci Number
```python
from fib import fibonacci_nth

# Calculate the 10th Fibonacci number
nth_number = fibonacci_nth(10)
print(nth_number)
```
